# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

## How to Play

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Enter your guess in the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button (not shown in the provided code, but assumed to exist).
4. The game will give you feedback:
   - If your guess is correct, the background turns green and a winning image appears.
   - If your guess is too low, you'll be told the correct number is higher.
   - If your guess is too high, you'll be told the correct number is lower.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
